            The Best Vanilla Cake

        <p>
            Out of all the cake recipes on my website, there’s a glaring absence. There’s white cake with a pristine <br>
            soft crumb, vanilla naked cake with a flavorful tight crumb, and checkerboard cake with a whimsical <br>
            design.

            Instructions
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment <br>
                paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly <br>
                release from the pans.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Whisk the cake flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the <br>
                butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. <br>
                Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. <br>
                 Beat in the 3 eggs, 2 egg whites, and vanilla extract on high speed until combined,<br>
                  about 2 minutes. (Mixture will look curdled as a result of the egg liquid and solid<br>
                   butter combining.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed.<br>
                    With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients just until combined. With<br>
                     the mixer still running on low, pour in the buttermilk and mix just until<br>
                      combined. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps<br>
                       at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.<br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Weigh them to ensure accuracy, if desired. Bake for <br>
                 around 23-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert<br>
                  a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. Allow cakes<br>
                   to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool<br>
                    before frosting and assembling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle<br>
                 attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add <br>
                 confectioners’ sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low.<br>
                  Increase to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add more confectioners’ sugar if <br>
                  frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt<br>
                   if frosting is too sweet.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat<br>
                 surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake<br>
                  turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with about 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting.<br>
                   Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with about 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting. <br>
                   Top with the third cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides.<br>
                    I use and recommend an icing spatula to apply the frosting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Refrigerate cake for at least 1 hour before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape<br>
                 when cutting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
            </li>
