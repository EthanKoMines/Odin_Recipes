            I feel like homemade noodles is like most things. You don’t realize how amazing a dish is with the extra <br>
             homemade factor until you try it. Like using store-bought flour tortillas versus homemade or uncooked<br>
              tortillas. Or using a homemade “cream of chicken soup” in a recipe instead of the stuff from the can.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first you may think it wont make much of a difference in taste, but once you’ve tried the from-scratch version<br>
             you’ll turn back!

            My mom always made her awesome chicken noodle soup with homemade noodles. She can whip them <br>
            together so quickly, and the ingredients are ones we always had on hand, so it was no big deal to her.

            Cooking and Storing

        <p>
            You can cook these immediately after making them by adding them to a pot of boiling soup–they are <br>
            my favorite to add to homemade chicken noodle soup. You can cook them in boiling water until tender <br>
            and serve them with Swedish meatballs, Beef Stroganoff, or plain with butter and parmesan cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drape them on a pasta drying rack or on a clean towel and let them dry completely. Transfer them to an <br>
             airtight container until you’re ready to cook them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You could also freeze the dough in a freezer-safe ziplock bag. Then, cook them, from frozen, in a pot of <br>
             boiling water or soup.

            Instructions
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix eggs, milk and salt together until smooth.  Stir in one cup of flour until smooth. Add <br>
                additional flour, just a small spoonful at a time, until the dough comes together in a ball, <br>
                but is still slightly sticky.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Dump dough out onto a floured surface. Use well floured hands to knead the dough with your hands,<br>
                 until it's no longer sticky, about 3-5 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Roll out onto a lightly floured counter until it's very thin -- less than 1/4'' thick or paper thin.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use a sharp knife or pizza cutting wheel to cut the noodles into long strips, however narrow <br>
                 or wide you like. I like to roughly gather them with my fingers into a pile to make them more<br>
                  shapely, and not so flat. You could even twist some with your fingers to make them prettier.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                To cook them immediately, add them to a pot of boiling water and cook until tender to the <br>
                bite, about 2-3 minutes. Drain and serve with butter and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.
